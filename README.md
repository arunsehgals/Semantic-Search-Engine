Semantic Search API using Flask
This repository contains code for a RESTful Semantic Search API built with Flask, enabling users to perform semantic searches across a collection of text files.

Features:
Semantic Search Functionality: Utilizes spaCy for text preprocessing, scikit-learn for TF-IDF vectorization, and cosine similarity for semantic search capabilities.
RESTful API: Provides a simple REST API endpoint /search where users can pass a query as a URL parameter to retrieve relevant text documents.
Text Preprocessing: Removes stopwords, tokenizes, converts to lowercase, and lemmatizes text for efficient search.


How to Use:
Setup:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure Python and necessary dependencies (Flask, spaCy, scikit-learn) are installed.


Data Preparation:

Replace the folder_path variable in app.py with the path to your directory containing text files.
Ensure data files are in .json format.


Run the Application:

Execute python app.py in your terminal to start the Flask server.
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/search.


Performing a Search:

Use a web browser or any HTTP client to send a GET request to /search endpoint with the query parameter (?query=YourQuery).


http://0.0.0.0:5000/search?query=YourQuery you can replace YourQuery with Query.


Results:
