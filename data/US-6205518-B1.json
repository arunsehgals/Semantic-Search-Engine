 Background Art</p><p>Power management for processors is a significant consideration, particularly for portable computers where a battery provides the power. Techniques for conserving battery charge by low power operation generally involves power minimizing AC power consumption and standby power consumption. The primary method of driving the AC power has been through the use of low power circuits and technology permitting lower values of VDD. U.S. Pat.

A microcode decode unit <b>12</b> is coupled to the source of microinstructions and decodes the instruction for each input cycle. Decode means <b>12</b> decodes the microinstructions and provides data to the system control registers. The output signals from decode means <b>12</b> sets all the latches of the system control registers for each cycle of microinstructions from source of microinstructions <b>10</b>.</p><p>Latch means <b>14</b> is coupled to decode means <b>12</b> and contains a plurality of latches that are clocked and set for each cycle in accordance with the decoded instruction.</p><p>The decode processor is a pseudo microcode processor, that is, for every cycle the microcode generates a set value for the latches. These values will then propagate through the system. In the prior art, the latches are set for the bits of each cycle of decoded instructions irrespective of the settings of the previous instruction. Because the values for the latch settings are random and can not be predicted, instructions in a cycle will be provided for particular settings of many latches, which latches may have been set in the same settings in the previous cycle. Thus the settings of the particular latches are not necessary and cause a reduction of battery power, especially in processor designs requiring many control latches.</p><p>Referring to FIG. 2, an embodiment of a processor according to the present invention is shown including the source of microinstructions <b>10</b>, the microcode decode means <b>12</b> and the latch means <b>14</b> as described for FIG. 1, as well as a clock gate control means <b>16</b> that is coupled to source of microinstructions <b>10</b>.</p><p>The function of clock gate control means <b>16</b> is to search and pick groups of clock gate control signals for latches that are the same value (state) as control signals from a previous cycle. Clock gate control means <b>16</b> includes a table <b>16</b>\u2212<b>2</b>, a table lookup means <b>16</b>\u2212<b>4</b>, a storage means <b>16</b>\u2212<b>6</b>, a compare means <b>16</b>\u2212<b>8</b> and a latch prevent means <b>16</b>\u2212<b>10</b>.</p><p>Clock gate control means <b>16</b> receives the microinstructions from source <b>10</b> simultaneously with decode means <b>12</b> and has its output coupled to latch means <b>14</b> for controllably clocking the latches such that setting instructions are not sent to latches that have been placed in the same setting during the previous cycle of microinstructions.</p><p>Clock gate control means <b>16</b> includes a storage device containing a table <b>16</b>\u2212<b>2</b> for storing and identifying a group of microinstructions that have a portion of their control bits set identically to corresponding portions of others of the group of microinstructions.</p><p>A table lookup means <b>16</b>\u2212<b>4</b> is connected to table <b>16</b>\u2212<b>2</b> for determining whether a microinstruction received from source of microinstructions <b>10</b> is a member of the group of microinstructions that have a portion of their control bits identically set to corresponding portions of others of the group of microinstructions. Table lookup means <b>16</b>\u2212<b>4</b> includes means for setting a membership bit to \u201ctrue\u201d if the received micro instruction is a member of the group.</p><p>Clock control gate means <b>16</b> further includes a storage means <b>16</b>-<b>6</b> for storing a membership bit corresponding to a previously received microinstruction from a previous cycle, a compare means <b>16</b>\u2212<b>8</b> for comparing a membership bit corresponding to the received microinstruction with the membership bit corresponding to a previously received microinstruction, and a latch prevent means <b>16</b>\u2212<b>10</b> connected to the latches in latch means <b>14</b> for providing a signal for preventing the clocking of those latches related to pairs of \u201ctrue\u201d membership bits that matched in the compare means <b>16</b>\u2212<b>8</b>.</p><p>Referring to FIG. 3, a flow chart is shown that describes the method of clock gate signal control according to the present invention.</p><p>In the first step of block <b>20</b>, a search is performed of the microcode for each instruction. In the second step of block <b>22</b> a number \u201cN\u201d such as 16 signals are picked or selected and in the third step of block <b>24</b> all the microcodes are searched in the table lookup means to see if they are at the same value as the N signals selected in step <b>22</b>. In the fourth step of block <b>26</b> temporary control bits are marked or designated for all the microcode matches.</p><p>In the fifth step of block <b>28</b> the microcode matches are saved in the storage means and then in the sixth step of block <b>30</b> a compare is performed in the compare means and the percentage of the matches are found to determined if the percentage of the matches is above an accepted level. Finally, in the seventh step of block <b>32</b> the lookup table is created with all of the microinstructions and their corresponding group settings.</p><p>Referring to FIG. 4, an example is illustrated describing the present invention wherein an add<b>1</b> opcode is dispatched as a microinstruction . The table lookup means decodes the opcode entry point to an entry point dedicated to the add instruction. A bit is set for every group of registers that can be clocked gate via this mechanism. For the add<b>1</b> opcode, the corresponding current <b>1</b>-N current cycle settings are set by the table lookup means. The previous cycle latched versions are then compared to the current value
